End-to-end gateway test for the cpex-output-length-guard plugin.

Drives the plugin's ``tool_post_invoke`` hook by echoing tool output through a
live gateway and asserts that:

* a payload exceeding ``max_chars`` is **blocked** when ``strategy: block``, and
* a payload within ``max_chars`` passes through unchanged.

The same assertions run against **both** enforcement paths, selected by the
``PLUGIN_ENFORCEMENT`` env var (set by the workflow matrix):

* ``static`` — the gateway boots with OutputLengthGuardPlugin in ``enforce``
  mode (config derived from ``plugins/config.yaml``), and
* ``binding`` — the gateway boots with OutputLengthGuardPlugin ``disabled`` and
  a runtime tool-plugin-binding flips it to ``enforce`` for the test's
  team+tool.

Both paths surface the identical block message, so one test body covers both.
The cpex plugin is never imported here — the gateway loads it from
``PLUGINS_CONFIG_FILE``; ``plugin_enforcement`` asserts it actually loaded so a
broken build fails loudly instead of skipping.

    ``strategy: block`` to surface ``isError=True`` on an oversized payload:

      matrix injects this into the derived config before the gateway boots.
