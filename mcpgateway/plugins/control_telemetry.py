Accumulator and emitter for CPEX control-execution telemetry.

Mirrors the structure of ``record_plugin_metrics()`` in ``plugins/utils.py``
but consumes **trusted** ``ControlExecutionRecord`` fields rather than
untrusted plugin metadata.  All bounds and sanitization follow the same
principles of bounded cardinality and field-level sanitization applied
throughout the plugin telemetry pipeline (see ``plugins/utils.py`` for the
shared ``_safe_str``/``_safe_num`` helpers and field-name allowlists).

Architecture
------------
One ``ControlTelemetryAccumulator`` is created per ``invoke_tool()`` call,
collects records from both ``tool_pre_invoke`` and ``tool_post_invoke`` hooks,
and is then flushed via ``record_control_telemetry()`` into two sinks:

  - Internal DB: a ``cpex.control.summary`` span + one ``cpex.control.result``
    child span per record, all batched in a single DB session.
  - OTel SDK: equivalent child spans under the active trace context (no-op
    when OTel is disabled or no context is active).

Feature gate
------------
The feature is a no-op when:

  - ``CPEX_CONTROL_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`` (config setting).

Existing ``tool.invoke`` spans, ``plugin.metrics.*`` spans, and CPEX
violation/on_error handling are untouched.
